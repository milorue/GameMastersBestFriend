**Dungeons and Dragons Campaign Manager**

*Client Description of Problem:*
Whenever I run a session, or even plan one, I find I have at least 10 to 20 tabs open at once to a wide range of sources. However I believe it would be much simpler if all this information was condensed into a single place. If it were all in a single location it would also make it infinitely easier for me to share information with my players and for them to share with me. This software would be a mix between google docs, roll20, and D&D beyond, combining all their best aspects for free. Separate folders store information about towns and cities, NPC’s, player characters, past sessions, history, monsters, homebrew items, maps, and future plans. Towns and cities would contain information about locations that have been visited, inhabitants, gossip, and specific history. NPC’s can be searched through based on location, race, class, importance, and occupation. Player characters would have their sheet, backgrounds, potential images, and other relevant aspects. Past sessions would simply be document notes divided by date. History would be divided between local, regional, and divine. Monsters would contain the information for any recently used, upcoming , or repeated encounters so as to be easily reached. A lot of things would link to other areas in order to enable ease of movement and minimal tab opening. Players would also have access to the campaign, but could only add to their own character, and only see what the GM has labeled as something they should be able to see.
